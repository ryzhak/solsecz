# solsecz - solidity security zoo
The idea of this repo is to combine all available solidity linters, static analysis tools and vulnerability search tools in one place. You run a single command on a smart contract - you get extensive output from all the tools.

Currently more tools are being added. All the tools are tested on vulnerable smart contracts from `vulnerable` folder. If you need to test your own contract then simply put it inside the `vulnerable` directory.

## How to use
1. clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run check`
